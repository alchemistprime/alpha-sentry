# Alpha Sentry Introduction Email

**Subject:** Alpha Sentry is live - take it for a spin

---

Hey,

Wanted to give you a heads up that Alpha Sentry is ready for testing. It's basically an AI research assistant built for our workflow - think of it as having a junior analyst who's really fast at pulling data and doing initial analysis.

**What it actually is:**
It's an "agent" - which just means it's an AI that can use tools, not just chat. When you ask it something, it figures out what data it needs, goes and gets it, then synthesizes an answer. You'll see it working in real-time (searching, analyzing, etc.) before it gives you a response.

**What it can do:**
- Pull financials (income statement, cash flow, balance sheet) for any public company
- Compare metrics across peers
- Analyze trends over multiple years
- Search for specific data points (DSO, FCF, margins, etc.)
- Web search for news/context when needed

**Good starting points:**
- "Analyze cash flow quality vs reported earnings for [ticker] - are there red flags?"
- "Compare days sales outstanding trends vs peers for [ticker]"
- "Compare [ticker]'s accounts receivable growth to revenue growth over 3 years"

**Keep in mind:**
This is iteration 001. It's going to have rough edges. Sometimes it might take a bit to respond on complex queries, or give you more/less detail than you wanted. That's all useful feedback.

Give it a shot when you have a few minutes: **https://alpha-sentry.vercel.app**

Let me know what you think - good, bad, or "why does it do *that*?"
